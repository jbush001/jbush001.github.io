A passage from Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren's "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567610.How_to_Read_a_Book" target="_blank">How to Read a Book</a>," discusses reading for understanding:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"If the book is completely intelligible to you from start to finish, then the author and you are as two minds in the same mold. The symbols on the page merely express common understanding you had before you met.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Let us take our second alternative. You do not understand the book perfectly. Let us even assume--what unhappily is not always true--that you understand enough to know that you do not understand it all. You know the book has more to say than you understand and hence it contains something that can increase your understanding...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Without external help of any sort, you go to work on the book. With nothing but the power of your own mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more. Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a book, is highly skilled reading, the kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding deserves"</blockquote><a name='more'></a><div>I think you could replace the word "book" with "source code" above and it would be equally applicable. However, although I've spent a lot of time reading source code for other people's programs, most of the time it doesn't feel like a highly skilled activity. It is often confusing and frustrating. That said, it is a necessary and useful way to learn, perhaps as much as writing code.</div><div><div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately for those interested in hardware architecture, and especially GPUs, source code is hard to come by and what exists of written documentation is often unhelpful. Although GPU manufacturers publish academic papers in journals and at conferences about their new architectures, they are often glorified marketing white papers with irritatingly little detail. Many PC review sites also present architectural "deep dives," but they're like reading Car and Driver when what you really want is a&nbsp;<a href="https://haynes.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Haynes Manual</a>. I'm not interested in memorizing the displacement or horsepower of various models: I want to know how the tappets are assembled.</div><div><div></div><br />Recently, I posted a high level analysis of a few commercial GPU implementations: the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-02-26-life-of-triangle %}" target="_blank">VideoCore IV GPU</a> and&nbsp;<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-07-24-gplgpu-walkthrough %}" target="_blank">GPLGPU</a>. I've found a few other interesting GPU focused projects and documentation that, while requiring some investment to understand, are worth serious study. Many of these include implementations that anyone can get running on their own machine in simulation. Being able to add print statements to a program see the sequence of operations and modify it to see how its behavior changes (or breaks) is a useful way to understand how it works.<br /><br /><h3>A Trip Through the Graphics Pipeline</h3><div><div><br /><a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/" target="_blank">https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/</a></div></div><div><br /></div><div>Fabian Giesen's well-written blog is full of interesting posts about computer hardware, programming, and graphics, but his 13 part series about the GPU pipeline is essential reading if you're interested in how GPUs work. It walks through the pipeline for a desktop class GPU with explanations of algorithms at each stage.<br /><br />Explaining something clearly necessarily requires simplification, and it is a tough balance to keep things clear while not oversimplifying to the point of creating more confusion. I think this series does a great job, elaborating where interesting and useful, and calling out where it has omitted details. It forms a good foundation for further study.<br /><br /></div><h3>MilkyMist One</h3><div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://github.com/m-labs/milkymist" target="_blank">https://github.com/m-labs/milkymist</a></div><div><br /></div></div><div>MilkyMist was a commercial VJ console released in 2010, used for displaying trippy visualizations synchronized to music on large projection screens at parties.&nbsp;It's visual effects are based on the MilkDrop WinAmp visualizer plugin. It contains a system-on-chip running on FPGA, including a CPU (based on Lattice Micro's open source LM32, with modifications to support virtual memory), a high performance memory subsystem, and peripherals for A/V output and input.&nbsp;The source code is modular and well organized.&nbsp;The components can be run on FPGA or in Verilog simulation.<br /><br />What's most impressive about this project is that it operates at full frame rates using modest FPGA hardware. Examining optimized implementations is useful, because many of the things you need to do to get good performance have deep design impacts.<br /><br />While it may not look like a GPU at first blush, it has a graphics pipeline to support visual effects that is similar to a fixed function 3D pipeline.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/m-labs/milkymist/tree/master/cores/tmu2">https://github.com/m-labs/milkymist/tree/master/cores/tmu2</a><br /><br />In the top level module tmu2.v, there are many blocks that look familiar from analysis of VideoCore and GPLGPU:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Vertex fetch</b> (tmu2_fetchvertex): reads vertex information from system memory and sends to the next pipeline stage. Milkymist performs image warping by breaking the source image into a grid of quadralaterals and adjusting the output coordinates. The VideoCore IV GPU also has a vertex engine that reads vertex attributes.</li><li><b>Parameter interpolation.</b>The modules tmu2_vdivops/tmu2_vdiv/tmu2_hdivops/tmu2_hdiv appear to perform setup for the texture interpolators, and the modules tmu2_vinterp/tmu2_hinterp perform interpolation to generate the source texture coordinates. The VideoCore IV had a hardware interpolator block, as did GPLGPU. MilkyMist is slightly simpler because it doesn't need to worry about perspective correction.</li><li><b>Texture Sampling</b>&nbsp;(tmu2_adrgen/tmu2_texmem/tmu2_blend) This is based on another influential paper I had spent some time reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture_prefetch/texture_prefetch_comp.pdf" target="_blank">Prefetching in a Texture Cache Architecture</a>. It's helpful to see a clean implementation of this algorithm. It would be interesting to compare this in more detail with the texture cache in GPLGPU, which was implemented before that paper came out.</li><li><b>Alpha Blending/Writeback </b>The modules&nbsp;tmu2_fdest/tmu2_alpha/tmu2_burst/tmu2_pixout handle alpha blending and memory access. This operates similar to the memory controller I discussed in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-07-24-gplgpu-walkthrough %}" target="_blank">GPLGPU walkthrough</a>. Alpha blending is a read/modify/write operation, so tmu2_fdest fetches the destination pixels, tmu2_alpha combines the old pixels with new, tmu2_burst collects a burst worth of pixels and tmu2_pixout writes them back to memory.</li></ul></div><div>There are other modules specific to the MilkDrop effect like tmu2_decay.<br /><br />The author's <a href="https://m-labs.hk/thesis/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">master's thesis</a>&nbsp;on this project is well worth reading. It discusses the challenges of getting high throughput from the memory subsystem and details the implementation of many components.</div><div><br /><h3>Attila</h3><div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://attila.ac.upc.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://attila.ac.upc.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a></div><div><a href="http://vmoya.site.ac.upc.edu/docs/ISPASS%20-%20ATTILASim.pdf">http://vmoya.site.ac.upc.edu/docs/ISPASS%20-%20ATTILASim.pdf</a></div><div><a href="https://github.com/attila-gpu/attila-sim">https://github.com/attila-gpu/attila-sim</a></div></div><div><br /></div><div>A group of PhD students at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia started the Atilla project to develop a microarchitecture for a desktop class GPU. It has been dormant since 2010, but is quite functional in its current form. It has a cycle-accurate C simulator of a full GPU pipeline, including both programmable and fixed function units. It does not have a synthesizable hardware implementation. It supports programmable shaders using the older&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARB_assembly_language" target="_blank">ARB shader syntax</a>.&nbsp;The project also has a shim library that can capture OpenGL/DirectX 9 commands from games running on a desktop machine and replay them through their simulator. The wiki has impressive (for their era) frame dumps rendered from games like Crysis, Half Life 2, and Call of Duty 2, which demonstrates that they have a fully functional system.<br /><br />This architecture allows both non-unified and unified shader models (in the former, there are dedicated shaders for vertex and fragment shader. The latter uses the same pool for both). Like GPLGPU, it is an immediate mode renderer: it writes completed pixels directly to dedicated graphics memory rather than an intermediate tile buffer.<br /><br /></div><div><i>(a note in the Wiki indicates that it unfortunately may disappear soon because one of the authors is no longer a student at the university that is hosting it).&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i></div></div><div><h3>GPGPU-SIM</h3><h3><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.gpgpu-sim.org/" target="_blank">http://www.gpgpu-sim.org/</a></div><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><a href="https://github.com/gpgpu-sim/" target="_blank">https://github.com/gpgpu-sim/</a></div><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.academia.edu/download/3239006/gpgpusim.ispass09.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.academia.edu/download/3239006/gpgpusim.ispass09.pdf</a></div></h3><h3><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;">This is a C simulator for the compute unit for a modern GPU implemented by a research group at the University of British Columbia. It is influenced by NVidia's architecture and can run CUDA programs written in <a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/" target="_blank">PTX intermediate code.</a>&nbsp;It has detailed documentation and includes a preconfigured virtual machine image to simplify setup. It does not include any fixed function graphics units, so it can't simulate graphics rendering out of the box.

This project highlights how untrue that is, with specialized hardware to handle a number of functions:</div><ul style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><li>Branch divergence. GPGPU-sim uses a stack of execution masks, described <a href="http://gpgpu-sim.org/manual/index.php/Main_Page#SIMT_Stack" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;For comparison, I discussed branch divergence in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-12-06-branch-divergence-in-parallel-kernels %}" target="_blank">this post</a>, but in the context of AMD's Southern Islands instruction set, which uses the 'exec' register rather than a stack to control execution.</li><li>Operand collector. Like many GPUs,&nbsp;GPGPU-sim simulates banked register files to save area and power&nbsp;(I described VideoCore's approach in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-03-01-videocore-qpu-pipeline %}" target="_blank">this post</a>). However, it uses a clever optimization to dynamically schedule register file access so the compiler doesn't need to worry about it. This implementation is described in detail <a href="http://gpgpu-sim.org/manual/index.php/Main_Page#Register_Access_and_the_Operand_Collector" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><li>Scoreboard. GPGPU-sim uses a scoreboard to track register dependencies, as described <a href="http://gpgpu-sim.org/manual/index.php/Main_Page#Scoreboard" target="_blank">here</a>. Nyuzi uses a similar scheme, as I documented in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-05-27-keeping-score %}" target="_blank">this post</a>.</li><li>Memory pipeline. This includes an address generation unit and access coalescing.</li></ul><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span><br /><ul style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"></ul></div></h3></div><h3>MIAOW</h3><div><br /></div><div><div><a href="https://github.com/VerticalResearchGroup/miaow">https://github.com/VerticalResearchGroup/miaow</a></div><div><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vinay/pubs/MIAOW-coolchips-paper.pdf">http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vinay/pubs/MIAOW-coolchips-paper.pdf</a></div></div><div><br /></div><div>This is a newer project, but is interesting in that it is binary compatible with a modern commercial (Southern Islands) GPU instruction set. Like GPGPU-Sim, it is only the compute unit and has no fixed function graphical units, so it is unable to simulate graphics rendering. However, unlike GPGPU-sim, it is a synthesizable hardware implementation. As stated in the Wiki: <i>"A primary motivator for MIAOW's creation is the belief that software simulators of hardware such as CPUs and GPUs often miss many subtle aspects that can skew the performance, power, and other quantitative results that they produce."</i> Creating synthesizable hardware ensures they accurately model hardware tradeoffs for their design decisions and can't inadvertently "cheat" like software simulators can.<br /><br /></div></div></div>
