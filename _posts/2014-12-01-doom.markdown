How many instructions does a processor need to execute to get through the
first level of Doom?  About 2.7 billion, in my case.  Over the course of the
several minutes it took me to stumble through the level, it rendered about
1080 frames, each of which required about 2.5 million instructions to produce.
The other 700 million instructions initialized the game, loading textures,
setting up data structures, etc.

I ported Doom to my [GPGPU
processor](https://github.com/jbush001/NyuziProcessor) recently. While it
doesn't use advanced hardware features of this architecture like hardware
multithreading, SIMD, or even floating point, it is a good test of the
toolchain and libraries, being substantially larger than other test programs
I've run.  It did shake out some good bugs.

*I forgot how much I sucked at this game*

The nice thing about the instruction set simulator (emulator) is that I can
instrument at a fairly fine grained level.  Here is breakdown of instructions
by type:

Interestingly, this matches the instruction profile of the 3D teapot renderer
I wrote within a few percent:

|----|----|
| load | 22.71% |
| store | 10.67% |
| branch | 11.81% |
| arithmetic | 54.45% |

I would have expected a program designed for a different generation of
hardware to have a different instruction profile (for example, Doom uses
lookup tables heavily, which I'd presume would make it more weighted towards
memory loads). However, that doesn't seem to be the case. Perhaps the
instruction distribution is influenced more by the compiler.

The simulator gets around 8 frames per second on my Core i5 laptop.  That
means it's executing around 20 million instructions per second on average.
The simulator isn't optimized, as I've mostly targeted it as a reference for
co-verification of the hardware model, so that's not too bad, I guess.

However, it's a speed demon compared to the cycle accurate Verilog simulation,
which shlumps along at the equivalent of 73kHz on my laptop. This is no fault
of [Verilator](http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator), the open source tool
I'm using to compile the model, which is actually very fast relative to other
simulators. It's just simulating the model at a high level of detail. I
managed to get it to initialize and render the first frame of the level over
the course of an hour and 20 minutes.  During that time, it executed around
353 million clock cycles.

|----|----|
| total cycles         | 353,708,911 |
| l2_writeback         | 88,342 |
| l2_miss              | 121,008 |
| l2_hit               | 4,505,554 |
| store rollback count | 2,200,227 |
| store count          | 6,519,751 |
| instruction_retire   | 77,984,252 |
| instruction_issue    | 93,883,016 |
| l1i_miss             | 2,133 |
| l1i_hit              | 158,202,234 |
| l1d_miss             | 304,961 |
| l1d_hit              | 9,045,137 |



The performance is pretty crummy. It only issues instructions about 26% of
clock cycles, the rest being idle, presumably because it is waiting on memory.
Of the issued instructions, only 83% are retired. It ends up rolling back the
rest because they were speculatively issued and couldn't complete.

I'd estimate it would get a little over 5 frames per second running on FPGA at
50Mhz.  This architecture depends on hardware threading to hide latency and
makes little effort otherwise to minimize it. It's designed for highly
parallel workloads.  If the game utilized a real 3D renderer, those threads
could be put to work rendering the scene in parallel.
